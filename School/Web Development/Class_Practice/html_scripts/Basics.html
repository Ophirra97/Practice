        <h1>Demystified HTML!</h1>

        <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML5.</p>

        <h2>Headings</h2>

        <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings
            <h1>Heading One, h1</h1>
            <h2>Heading Two, h2</h2>
            <h3>Heading Three, h3</h3>
            <h4>Heading Four, h4</h4>
            <h5>Heading Five, h5</h5>
            <h6>Heading Six, h6</h6>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Lists</h2>

        <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add a "ul" element(it stands for unorder list)</li>
            <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
            <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is how to make an ordered list:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
            <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
            <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
            <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order,
                because this is an ordered list</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Inline Elements</h2>

        <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
        <p>Other times you need to <strong>Strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance 
            of a word or phrase.</p>
        <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
