        <p>This is my practice webpage. I have placed many items on this page from images to widgets. I plan to practice my HTML and CSS 
            elements with this page.</p>
        <p>I hope that I can showcase a lot of skills with this webpage and be able to make something both fun and complex. With that being
            said I am still rather new to the process and am unsure what I should create. Therefore good luck on the journey with me.</p>
